# Uala Challenge - Performance Optimization Documentation

## Overview
This project involves displaying and filtering a large dataset of approximately 200,000 cities. Due to the size of the dataset, performance issues may arise, particularly when searching, filtering, and rendering the list of cities in real-time. Below, we document the challenges encountered, their performance implications, and the solutions implemented to address them.

## Identified Performance Issues

### 1.  **Memory Usage in Rendering**
   - **Problem:**
     Rendering all cities in a single `List` or `ForEach` caused high memory usage and decreased UI responsiveness.
   - **Solution:**
     - Switched to using `LazyVStack` within a `ScrollView` to ensure that only visible items are rendered in memory, improving responsiveness.
